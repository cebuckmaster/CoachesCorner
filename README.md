Youth Soccer Coaching App

This is my Capstone Stage 2 project.   It is a youth Soccer Coaching App to help keep track of game schedule, team roster.  On game day the app can be used to track substitution time and what players make goals, assists and saves through out the game.  

This app uses google Map Services to show the field location.  You will have to use your own Google maps key which should be stored in your local gradle.properties file called GooglMapsKey
